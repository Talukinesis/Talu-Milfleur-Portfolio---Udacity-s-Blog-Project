                            Now this is a story all about how my life got flip turned upside 
                            down. I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll 
                            tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In West Philadelphia born and raised
                            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                            Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
                            And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
                            When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                            She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air</p>
                        <p>
                            I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                            But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                            She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                            I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First class, yo this is bad
                            Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
                            Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                            Hmm, this might be alright
                        </p>
